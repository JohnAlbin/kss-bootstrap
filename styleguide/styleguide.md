# Bootstrap Styleguide

A [style guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide) provides a means of documenting basic rules or features that will allow you to ensure consistency in the design. It makes your website look and read consistently, translating to a better user experience, higher usability and ultimately fulfils a websiteâ€™s goals more effectively.

Provided is a [KSS](http://warpspire.com/kss/)-powered [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) style guide to test various Bootstrap components in three different sections:

* [CSS](section-1.html)
* [Components](section-2.html)
* [JavaScript](section-3.html)
