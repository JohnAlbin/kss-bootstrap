# KSS Bootstrap

A [style guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide) provides a means of documenting basic rules or features that will allow you to ensure consistency in the design. It makes your website look and read consistently, translating to a better user experience, higher usability and ultimately fulfils a websiteâ€™s goals more effectively.
